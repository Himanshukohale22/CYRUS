# CYRUS
This is TCV rocketry flight computer


TVC roketry is thrust vectoring controll rocket design.
by the help of cad design and some best electronics,
TCV rocket can be made.
In this cyrus computer the on board computer is stm32f4 series microcontroller which has 100MHz operating frequency.
for fast and crusial data collection , controlling pyro cannels and thurst vestors motors.
with the help of baromatric sensor (bmp280) , inertial mesurment unit (mpu6050) , and RF module (nrf24).
